# Personality-Cluster-Predictor
This project builds a complete psychological profiling pipeline using unsupervised learning (K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models) and supervised learning (Random Forest Classifier + CatBoost Soft-Label Predictor). It classifies individuals into psychological clusters and predicts personality-type membership for new users based on questionnaire data.
This project analyzes psychological assessment data by integrating multiple personality frameworks—including Big Five, 16PF primary factors, MBTI dichotomies, and a Traditional Family Orientation scale—into a unified dataset of 30 traits per participant. After preprocessing (cleaning, imputing missing values, and standardizing features), unsupervised learning methods (K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models) were used to discover underlying personality clusters. Two supervised models were then trained: a Random Forest Classifier to predict hard cluster labels and a CatBoost Multi-Output Regressor to predict soft probabilistic cluster membership. Both models were deployed to provide real-time personality cluster predictions based on new user inputs. A Streamlit-based web interface allows end-users to enter questionnaire scores and receive their predicted personality cluster along with probability distributions, making the system accessible and interpretable for psychologists and researchers.
