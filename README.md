# Personality-Cluster-Predictor
This project builds a complete psychological profiling pipeline using unsupervised learning (K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models) and supervised learning (Random Forest Classifier + CatBoost Soft-Label Predictor). It classifies individuals into psychological clusters and predicts personality-type membership for new users based on questionnaire data.
